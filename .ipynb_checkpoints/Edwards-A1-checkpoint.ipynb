    "So far, you've learned very important fundamental concepts in Machine Learning such as supervised learning (e.g. classification and regression) vs unsupervised learning (e.g. clustering), overfitting, model evaluation, and performance measures (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, MSE, etc.). You've learned that two of the most common approaches in supervised learning are regression and classification. In this assignment, you are going to practice what you've learned so far by building ML models and applying them on data.\n",

    "<b>Very Important Note:</b> Read ALL the instructions in this notebook very carefully. Careless reading and skipping instructions are major sources of making mistakes and losing points in your assignments! Also notice that this assignment has three parts and includes multiple steps and questions. You're strongly recommended to get started early and plan to finish well before the due date. Technical problems or other issues/questions on the due date or just a day before would NOT be accepted as an excuse for extension. As stated in the policy, ALL assignments are indvidual tasks and students are strictly prohibited from collaboration on assignments. Students are responsible to debug the code and resolve any errors that may arise. Students should NOT share any answer, solution, or code/snippet with other students. Violations of these policies would be penalized according to UMBC academic integrity policy."

    "Notice that we use [`.fit()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.fit) method applied on `(X_train, y_train)` for training and [`.predict()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.predict) method applied on `(X_test)` without showing the lables `y_test` for making predictions (testing). Click on the methods and read their sklearn documentation for further information. XGBoost documentation for [`.fit()`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html#xgboost.dask.DaskXGBRanker.fit) and [`.predict()`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html#xgboost.dask.DaskXGBRanker.predict) methods suggests that their usage is similar to sklearn.
